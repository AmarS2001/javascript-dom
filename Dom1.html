<!--The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, XML documents, and their component parts (e.g. elements).
A Web page is a document.
The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
In the beginning, JavaScript and the DOM were tightly intertwined, but eventually, they evolved into separate entities.
Implementations of the DOM can be built for any language, as this Python
innerHTML- read or write from or to the html element.
